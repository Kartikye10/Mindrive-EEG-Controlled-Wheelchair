# Mindrive-EEG-Controlled-Wheelchair

## Project Overview
The project aims to create an EEG-controlled wheelchair system for individuals with severe physical disabilities, enabling control through brain signals rather than traditional joysticks or switches. By processing alpha waves (7-13Hz) from EEG signals, the system translates user intentions into directional commands (forward, backward, left, right) and stop commands. The focus is on minimizing the number of EEG channels to reduce costs. Machine learning and deep learning techniques will classify these signals, while real-time object detection via a Pi camera will enhance navigation and safety. This intuitive system aims to provide a cost-effective, user-friendly solution for enhanced mobility.
